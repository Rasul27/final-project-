## 📄 Project Description

The **Resume Database Management System** is a 
Java-based console application that allows 
users to manage resumes of job applicants.
Users can create, read, update, and delete resume 
records using a command-line interface. All data is 
validated and stored persistently in a file 
using object serialization. The system supports 
import/export operations and generates useful 
reports such as total resumes and activity logs.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement core **CRUD operations** for resume records.
- Provide a **user-friendly CLI interface** with clear prompts.
- Ensure **input validation** (e.g., email format, non-empty names).
- Enable **file-based persistence** for saving/loading resumes.
- Design with a **modular structure** for clean, maintainable code.
- Generate **summary reports** (e.g., number of resumes, logs).
- Include **error handling** for all I/O operations and invalid inputs.
- Support **import and export** functionality (e.g., CSV, JSON).
- Maintain complete **documentation** in code and README.
- Ensure **test cases and screenshots** demonstrate all functions.
